This repository is for hacking the board game Monopoly to educate about online privacy and security.
The idea is to take the basic principle of Monopoly - to control all the assets on a game board and thus drive your competition out of business - and flip it so that the player of the game is now breaking down the monopoly of an internet conglomerate.

The assets and plots of the original game would in this version be parts of the conglomerate. The players' goal would be to take it down piece by piece by acquiring knowledge or tools for making their internet journey safer/more private.

Another take could be that some/one players' job is to prevent this from happening by playing the part of the conglomerate.
